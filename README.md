#  Weather & Air Quality Dashboard – For India’s Major Cities

This dashboard is my way of bringing **weather and pollution data together in one simple, visual tool.**
Instead of jumping between apps for temperature, forecasts, and AQI, I wanted to design a clean, interactive report that gives people everything they need — at a glance — for **cities like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, New Delhi, and Chennai.**

## Why I built this

We all check the weather almost every day — whether it’s to decide if we need an umbrella, plan a trip, or even just pick what to wear. But beyond weather, **air quality has become equally important** for health and planning. The problem is, both of these data points are often scattered.

This dashboard solves that by combining **real-time weather conditions, 7-day forecasts, and detailed air quality data** into one place.

## How I built it

I created this using **Power BI**, pulling in live data through **weather and air quality APIs.**

* **Power Query** helped me clean and prepare the raw data.
* **DAX formulas** let me add custom metrics like average AQI and dynamic rain percentages.
* I then designed the visuals to be **intuitive, minimal, and easy to scan** so anyone could quickly find the info they care about.

## What it shows

Here’s what you can explore on the dashboard:

**Current conditions** for each city (temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and more).
**7-day temperature trends** to see how the week is shaping up.
**Chance of rain** by day (e.g., 99% in Delhi on Sunday, 100% in Kolkata on Tuesday).
**Air Quality Index (AQI)** — with pollutant breakdowns like PM2.5, PM10, CO, O3, and SO2.
**Sunrise & sunset times** to plan your day.

## Why it matters

For **everyday people**, it helps answer simple but important questions: *Do I need an umbrella? Is it safe to go for a morning run?*
For **businesses**, it supports decisions in logistics, travel, and outdoor operations.
For **health & policy makers**, it highlights pollution hotspots and trends across Indian cities.

In short: this dashboard takes something we all use daily — the weather — and makes it **smarter, richer, and more useful**
by blending it with air quality insights.
